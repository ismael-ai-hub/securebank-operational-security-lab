# \# SecureBank Operational Security Lab

# 

# \## Overview

# 

# SecureBank Operational Security Lab is a professional simulation of a banking Security Operations Center (SOC) environment.

# 

# This project demonstrates how authentication monitoring, brute force detection, incident reporting, and operational risk assessment can be integrated into a structured security workflow aligned with financial industry practices.

# 

# The objective is to simulate real-world security operations in a banking context, combining technical detection mechanisms with governance and risk management principles.
